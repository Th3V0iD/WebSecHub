What are Dorks?
----------------------------

	Using dorks is not hard, it's pretty easy if you know what you are doing and also it's a cool way to step in the hacking world.
	
	Dorks are keywords that if used on search-engines can return some specific webpages, examples:
		-> An site admin page.
		-> Exploits
		-> Restricted Areas
		Etc..
	Using dorks is pretty useful to find vulnerable pages and it's widely used to mass-search some exploits.
------------------------
 Using Dorks
------------------------

	Here I'll teach you how to use dorks with google, google has lots of keywords to "filter" google results, some examples are:
	
		-> "site:" - Search on specific url, great to search, for example, just on .gov.br sites.
		-> "inurl:" - Search sites that have a specific string in their URL, for example, you can use it to find just sites with "php?id=" in the URL.
		-> "intitle:" - Search pages that have a specific string in their page name. For example find pages titled "admin panel"
		-> "filetype:" - Search files that have an specific extensions. Example: "filetype:txt" will find txt files.
		-> "allinurl:" - Search urls that have all the keywords in the query
		-> "allintitle:" - Search for pages that have in title all the keywords of the query
		-> "link:" - Searches for external links to pages
		-> "allintext:" - Searches for a string inside an page.

	Example querys using dorks:
	
		-> "site:.gov.br inurl:.php?id=" - Search for .gov.br sites with ".php?id=" in their URLS (Good to search sqlinjectable pages).
		-> "inurl:/admin/login.asp" - Search for some admin login pages.
		-> "inurl:login.asp" - Search for common login pages
		-> "allinurl:"exchange/logon.asp" - Microsoft (R) Outlook (TM) Web Access is a Microsoft Exchange Active Server Application that gives you private access to your Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Exchange personal e-mail account so that you can view your Inbox from any Web Browser.

Finding SQL Injectable pages with dorks
-------------------------------------------------------------

Those are some dorks to find SQL injectable pages: (".php" part is optional)
Modify them as you like.

	-> "inurl:.php?id="
	-> "inurl:.php?cat="
	-> "inurl:.php?num="
	-> "inurl:.php?storeid="
	-> "inurl:.php?bookid="
	-> "inurl:.php?cartid="
	-> "inurl:.php?iCat="
	-> "inurl:.php?CatalogID="
	-> "inurl:.php?catid="
	-> "inurl:.php?product_id="
	-> "inurl:.php?service_id="
	-> "inurl:.php?item="
	-> "inurl:.php?title="
	-> "inurl:.php?iid="
	-> "inurl:.php?type="
	-> "inurl:.php?action="
	-> "inurl:.php?pid="
	-> "inurl:.php?i="
	-> "inurl:.php?ref="
	-> "inurl:.php?view="
	-> "inurl:.php?pageid="
	-> "inurl:.php?page_id="
	
In "HackBox" (See it at my GitHub) we have an tool to find SQL injectable pages with dorks and test it.
You can also test xss on those :)

-------------------------------------------------------------
     Finding Admin pages with dorks
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is not easy, but it's possible, there is a list of the most common admin pages:
If you want to find an site admin page, use this as dork: "site:www.site.org *dork*"
--- The Best way to find an admin page is manually. ----
For the way, there are some dorks.

	-> "inurl:admin" -Not precise, sometimes it will show not admin pages
	-> "inurl:admin1.php"
	-> "inurl:admin1.html"
	-> "inurl:admin2.php"
	-> "inurl:admin2.html"
	-> "inurl:yonetim.php"
